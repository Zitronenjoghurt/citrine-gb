# 0.6.0 - 2026-08-21

## Added

- Disassembly tab with static ROM analysis, instruction breakpoints and per-instruction reference info
- Audio Debug and APU Waves tabs for inspecting the sound hardware while a game runs
- Performance tab showing emulation and frame timings
- Input recording (Debug Actions tab): captures button presses with cycle timestamps for replay
- Snapshots: unlimited save-state slots per game with thumbnails
- A Saves tab with `.sav` import and export
- Recently played ROMs in the file menu (native only)
- Optional randomized power-on RAM, matching how real hardware boots (Settings → Developer)
- Full emulator state dump as JSON
- MBC5 cartridge support
- Frame-by-frame accuracy comparison against the SameBoy reference emulator (`lab/`), with committed
  result snapshots under `experiments/`
- Per-ROM mooneye test suite runner (`make test-mooneye`)

## Changed

- Saves are now stored per game (identified by ROM contents) in Citrine's application data folder
  instead of next to the ROM file. Existing `.sav` files are imported automatically the first time
  you load their game, and the originals are left in place

## Fixed

- Saves are now written when you close the emulator, so the last few seconds of play are no longer lost
- Bundled homebrew games can now save
- A `.gb` and a `.gbc` of the same game no longer share (and overwrite) one save file
- Saving in the web version now works outside Chromium-based browsers
- Inverted DMG post-boot `F` flags (half-carry/carry are set when the header checksum is non-zero)
- Interrupt dispatch now reads the target vector from `IE` after pushing the return address, so a
  stack push onto `$FFFF` can redirect or cancel the interrupt
- `RETI` now enables `IME` immediately instead of after the following instruction
- Breakpoints are now checked every instruction instead of once per frame, so they actually trigger
- Unused I/O register bits now read as 1 (serial `SC`, `TAC`), unmapped I/O registers read `0xFF`,
  and `IE` is a full 8-bit read/write register
- The HALT bug is now emulated
- Building the library standalone with only the `debug` feature failed to compile
